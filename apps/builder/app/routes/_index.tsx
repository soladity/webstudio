// We want our catch-all route to also handle `/`.
// Unfortunately, Remix doesn't do this by default,
// see https://github.com/remix-run/remix/issues/2098#issuecomment-1049262218 .
// To solve this, we're re-exporting the $.tsx route API in index.tsx

// We're wrapping functions in order for them to be distinct from the ones in $.tsx.
// If they are the same, Remix may get confused, and don't load data on page transitions.

export const loader = (args: LoaderArgs) => catchAllloader(args);
export const ErrorBoundary = () => <CatchAllErrorBoundary />;
